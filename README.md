# Micro-Project-Frist-In-Html-Css
This Is First Micro Project on Html and Css
# Mini Project 1 
This repository contains a simple web page created using HTML and CSS. The web page showcases a design and prompt generator website called "Dweep.io". Here's a breakdown of the project files:

index.html: This file contains the HTML structure of the web page. It consists of a header section and a footer section.

styles.css: This CSS file is linked to the HTML file and contains the styles for various elements on the web page. It defines classes for different sections and elements such as headers, footers, input fields, buttons, and social icons.

To view the web page, simply open the index.html file in a web browser.

Please note that this is a simplified version of the README file. You can add more details or instructions as needed, such as how to customize the styles or how to deploy the web page to a server.
